Yes is indicated with either a 'true' or '1'. No is indicated with either a 'false' or '0'. An elevated building is a no-basement building that was constructed so as to meet the following criteria:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. The top of the elevated floor (all A zones) or the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (all V zones) is above ground level.                                                                                                            2.

This represents the approximate location of the insured property. The precision has been lessened to ensure individual privacy. This may result in a point location that exists in an incorrect county or state. Use the state and county fields for record aggregation for these dimensions</span>

Yes is indicated with either a 'true' or '1'. No is indicated with either a 'false' or '0'.  An elevated building is a no-basement building that was constructed so as to meet the following criteria: 1. The top of the elevated floor (all A zones) or the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (all V zones) is above ground level;2. The building is adequately anchored;3. The method of elevation is pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls (not in V zones), or solid foundation perimeter walls (not in V zones);</span>
