The PA Program also encourages protection of these damaged facilities from future events by providing assistance for hazard mitigation measures during the recovery process.This dataset lists all public assistance recipients (sub-grantees) and a summary of the funded program support. This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error.

The PA Program also encourages protection of these damaged facilities from future events by providing assistance for hazard mitigation measures during the recovery process.This dataset lists all public assistance recipients (sub-grantees) and a summary of the funded program support.

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert Water Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12): Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program. For more information on the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, please visit: https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.The dataset contains properties by project identifier, city, zip code, state and region and does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The mitigated property dataset can be joined to the OpenFEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset by the Project Identifier field. Note, not all projects in the Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset will have mitigated properties (e.g., Planning and Management Cost projects). In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (sub-recipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems. The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's mitigation grant systems (NEMIS-MT and e-Grants) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The financial information is derived from FEMA's mitigation grant systems and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as www.usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.Missing values - In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (subrecipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems. The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.A newer version of this OpenFEMA data set has been released. This older dataset version will no longer be updated and will be archived by the end of April 2020.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. '' 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The FY 2016 EMPG will provide federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) (the Goal's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The federal government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system. The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the National Preparedness Goal. Examples include: - Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process; - Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structures; - Updating and approving specific emergency plans; - Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA; - Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities; - Initiating or achieving a whole community approach to security and emergency management.

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects that reduces disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert Water Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012: Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program.

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert Water Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12): Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program. For more information on the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, please visit: https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.The dataset contains properties by project identifier, city, zip code, state and region and does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The mitigated property dataset can be joined to the OpenFEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset by the Project Identifier field. Note, not all projects in the Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset will have mitigated properties (e.g., Planning and Management Cost projects). In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (sub-recipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems. The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record. This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.Missing values - In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (subrecipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems.

ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.The only measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.AFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.Grants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually.

The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.If you have media inquiries about this dataset please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

This dataset lists all official FEMA Disaster Declarations, beginning with the first disaster declaration in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: major disaster, emergency, and fire management assistance. The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas (county not available before 1964; Fire Management records are considered partial due to historical nature of the dataset).Please note the unique structure of the disaster sequencing (due to a numbering system that originated in the 1950's-1970's):0001-1999     Major Disaster Declaration2000-2999     Fire Management3000-3999     Emergency Declaration (Special Emergency)4000-              Major Disaster DeclarationFor more information on the disaster declaration process, see https://www.fema.gov/disasters and https://www.fema.gov/disasters/how-declared This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The dataset is primarily composed of historical data that was manually entered into NEMIS after it launched in 1998. The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations, and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as www.usaspending.gov. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.A newer version of this OpenFEMA data set has been released. This older dataset version will no longer be updated and will be archived by the end of April 2020. The following page details the latest version of this data set: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-dataset-disaster-declarations-summaries-v2. CSV and JSON Files can be downloaded from the 'Full Data' section.To access the dataset through an API endpoint, visit the 'API Endpoint' section of the above page. Accessing data in this fashion permits data filtering, sorting, and field selection. The OpenFEMA API Documentation page provides information on API usage.

<span class='r-out co'><span class='r-pr'>#&gt;</span> 18 1.1. What is the data in the submission?Individual Assistance is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters.Homeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance.Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.Disaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.This dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA's IHP unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdfIndividual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.1.2. How is it generated?The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.1.3. How can the data be used?The data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.OpenFEMA customers can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.Community groups in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective and equitable recovery.Citation: The Agency's preferred citation for datasets (API usage or file downloads) can be found on the OpenFEMA Terms and Conditions page, Citing Data section: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions.Please note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. Any financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.  Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.If you have media inquiries about this dataset please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

The HMGP provides grants to states and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuityAcquisition or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.Missing values - In some cases the projects are closed and the data was simply not provided by the sub-grantee or the Grantee and/or entered into the HMGP system. It is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record. While it is strongly encouraged, it is not required for this data to be provided in the HMGP system for the project to be closed out.

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12): Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program. For more information on the Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs, please visit: https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's mitigation grant systems (NEMIS-MT and e-Grants) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. The financial information is derived from FEMA's mitigation grant systems and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.Missing values - In some cases data was not provided by the subgrantee (subrecipient), grantee (recipient) and/or entered into the FEMA mitigation grant systems. The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.A newer version of this OpenFEMA data set has been released.

Any financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.  Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov; this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.

This dataset contains aggregated, non-PII data on FEMA's Housing Assistance Program within the state, county, zip where the registration is valid for the declarations, starting with disaster declarations number 4116.  The data is divided into data for renters and data for property owners. Additional core data elements include number of applicants, county, zip code, severity of damage, owner or renter. Data is self-reported and as such is subject to human error. To learn more about disaster assistance please visit https://www.fema.gov/individual-disaster-assistance.This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. For example, when an applicant registers they enter their street and city address.  The system runs a check and suggests a county.  The applicant, if registering online can override that choice.  If they are registering via the call center the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives are instructed to ask (not offer) what county they live in.  So even though the system might suggest County A,  an applicant has the right to choose County B.  The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.

All PII information has been removed. The location is represented by county, city, and zip code. This dataset contains IA applications from DR1439 (declared in 2002) to those declared over 30 days ago. The full data set is refreshed on an annual basis. A weekly refresh occurs to update disasters declared in the last 18 months. IHP is intended to meet basic needs and supplement disaster recovery efforts. The IHP is not intended to return disaster-damaged property to its pre-disaster condition. Disaster damage to secondary or vacation homes does not qualify for IHP assistance.

IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.Organized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems.This data set contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system. To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.The data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdfSee also:IPAWS Architecture - https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/ipaws/architecture_diagram.pdfIPAWS Overview - https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-systemThis is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450 Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information. This happens only on rare occasions. Earlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. Note that the original IPAWS CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message. See the originalMessage field for additional details.If you have media inquiries about this dataset please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.  For inquiries about FEMA's data and Open government program please contact the OpenFEMA team via email OpenFEMA@fema.dhs.gov. IPAWS specific queries should be sent to the general mailbox (IPAWS@fema.dhs.gov). Copies will be sent from the mailbox to IPAWS leadership and Subject Matter Experts.</span>

The Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects by NFIP CRS Communities dataset can be joined to the OpenFEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset by the Project Identifier field. Note, not all projects in the Hazard Mitigation Assistance Funded Project dataset will associate to an NFIP CRS Community. For more information on the NFIP CRS Program, visit https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/rules-legislation/community-rating-system.FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects that reduces disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program) and Biggert Water Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program).

This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and Mitigation eGrants Systems and is dependent on Regional entry, as such it is subject to a small percentage of human error and delayed entry of plan information. The data is updated from authoritative sources and has a minimum 24 hour delay. This dataset is not derived from FEMA's official financial system and is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, the financial information in this dataset may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov.

This dataset contains aggregated, non-PII data on FEMA's Housing Assistance Program within the state, county, zip where the registration is valid for the declarations, starting with disaster declarations number 4116.  The data is divided into data for renters and data for property owners. Additional core data elements include number of applicants, county, zip code, severity of damage, owner or renter. Data is self-reported and as such is subject to human error. To learn more about disaster assistance please visit https://www.fema.gov/individual-disaster-assistance.This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. For example, when an applicant registers they enter their street and city address.  The system runs a check and suggests a county.  The applicant, if registering online can override that choice.  If they are registering via the call center the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives are instructed to ask (not offer) what county they live in.  So even though the system might suggest County A,  an applicant has the right to choose County B.  The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.

The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.Hazard mitigation planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters. It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area. After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)Hazard mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments to:- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and vulnerabilities- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments, organizations, businesses, and the public- Identify long-term strategies that seek to reduce risk- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, territorial or local objectives- Identify implementation actions to focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities- Connect priorities to potential funding sources- Increase investment in mitigation actionsA FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance.Please note that jurisdictions may participate in multiple plans.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. The paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds.

Mission Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources to support disaster needs.1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?FEMA issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.When States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8 (c).1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?Mission Assignments are administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic forms within FEMA's financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor, statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work, or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing and reimbursement.This data set contains information required as part of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information for stakeholders:- State or Tribal Government- Disaster Number- Description of Disaster - Agency- Request for Assistance- Obligations/Estimate- Date Obligated- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government is responsible (the cost share)For more information on Mission Assignments, the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov1.4 How is the data generated?The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments for FEMA's Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.1.5 How can the data be used?The data provides information regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response to Stafford Act incidents.  Note: The disaster costs reflected are not actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial report and should not be considered an official federal report.

In 2016, FEMA developed this two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery model dataset differs from other dataset as it specifies what phase current grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused on only awarded Grants. Short description of the PA Phases: Phase I - Operational Planning: Identify applicants' disaster impacts and recovery priorities.Phase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis: Capture and document all of the incident-related damagesPhase III - Scoping and Costing: Further develop PA grant projects for final processing.Phase IV - Obligation: Obligate projects.For more details, please see: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_pa_delivery-model_factsheet.pdf                                                                                                                                                         For other additional information, please see:Grants Manager/Grants Portal Fact Sheet: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_pa_grants-manager-grants-protal-tool_factsheet.pdfPA Delivery Model Fact Sheet: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_pa_delivery-model_factsheet.pdfThe establishment of the Grants Manager and Grant Portal as the processing system for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future, EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system of record for obligations.A descriptive list of two of the code fields in the data dictionary are presented here as they are difficult to read if embedded in the field description:Applicant StatusEligible - Applicant is eligible to apply for and receive FEMA Public Assistance grantsIneligible - Applicant has been determined ineligible to apply for and receive FEMA Public Assistance grantsWithdrawn - Applicant has withdrawn eligibility to apply for and receive FEMA Public Assistance grantsPending Recipient RPA Review - Pending reviews by the Recipient of the Applicant's request for Public AssistancePending FEMA RPA Review - Pending reviews by FEMA of the Applicant's request for Public AssistancePending Ineligibility Review - Pending final review to determine eligibility of the ApplicantPending RPA Ineligibility Review - Pending final review to determine eligibility of the Applicant's request for Public AssistancePending Applicant Resubmission - Pending resubmittal of a request for Public AssistanceClosed - Eligible - Eligible Applicant has been closed outApplicant Process Status specifies the process currently pending for the Applicant or their request for Public Assistance.
