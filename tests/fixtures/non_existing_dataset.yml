        Assistance (HMA) grant programs. FEMA administers three programs that provide
        funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses
        and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs
        are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance

        Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.\n\nThe only
        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents

        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information
        on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.\n\nMissing values

        Archived Alerts","description":"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System
        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.
        To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies
        with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.\nThe
        data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found
        in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf\nSee

        is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the
        IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450
        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of
        each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours

        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability
        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued
        through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards
        Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. \nNote that the original IPAWS
        CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON
        object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as
        a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original
        format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such
        as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message.

        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate

        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary

        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency
        Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE
        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system
        of record for obligation.\n\nA descriptive list of two of the code fields

        information on both Non-Disaster (ND) and Assistance to Firefighter Grants
        (AFG) data. ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants
        Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.\n\nThe only
        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents
        and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.\n\nFor more information on

        Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters","description":"1.1. What
        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information

        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.

        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of

        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued

        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        NFIP Redacted Policies","description":"Congress passed the National Flood
        Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood
        Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood
        hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection.
        The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered
        the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its
        creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA''s Write
        Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures
        as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures
        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,
        and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of
        the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and
        processing insurance claims. \n\nThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments
        for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund
        (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42
        U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated
        fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. \n\nThis data
        set is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting
        platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.\n\nThe
        NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf)

        Assignments","description":"1.1 What is the data in the submission?\n\nMission
        Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order
        issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified
        task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. \n\nMission
        Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management
        under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow
        for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources
        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system

        Assistance (HMA) grant programs. FEMA administers three programs that provide
        funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses
        and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs
        are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance

        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents

        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information
        on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.\n\nMissing values

        Archived Alerts","description":"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System
        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.
        To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies
        with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.\nThe
        data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found
        in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf\nSee

        is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the
        IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450
        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of
        each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours

        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability
        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued
        through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards
        Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. \nNote that the original IPAWS
        CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON
        object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as
        a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original
        format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such
        as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message.

        Mitigation Plan Statuses","description":"The data found on this page comes
        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,

        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency
        Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE
        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system
        of record for obligation.\n\nA descriptive list of two of the code fields

        information on both Non-Disaster (ND) and Assistance to Firefighter Grants
        (AFG) data. ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants
        Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.\n\nThe only
        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents
        and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.\n\nFor more information on

        Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters","description":"1.1. What
        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information

        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.

        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of

        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued

        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        NFIP Redacted Policies","description":"Congress passed the National Flood
        Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood
        Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood
        hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection.
        The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered
        the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its
        creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA''s Write
        Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures
        as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures
        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,
        and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of
        the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and
        processing insurance claims. \n\nThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments
        for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund
        (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42
        U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated
        fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. \n\nThis data
        set is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting
        platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.\n\nThe
        NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf)

        Assignments","description":"1.1 What is the data in the submission?\n\nMission
        Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order
        issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified
        task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. \n\nMission
        Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management
        under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow
        for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources
        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system

        Assistance (HMA) grant programs. FEMA administers three programs that provide
        funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses
        and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs
        are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance

        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents

        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information
        on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.\n\nMissing values

        Archived Alerts","description":"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System
        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.
        To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies
        with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.\nThe
        data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found
        in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf\nSee

        is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the
        IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450
        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of
        each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours

        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability
        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued
        through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards
        Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. \nNote that the original IPAWS
        CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON
        object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as
        a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original
        format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such
        as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message.

        Mitigation Plan Statuses","description":"The data found on this page comes
        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,

        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency
        Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE
        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system
        of record for obligation.\n\nA descriptive list of two of the code fields

        information on both Non-Disaster (ND) and Assistance to Firefighter Grants
        (AFG) data. ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants
        Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.\n\nThe only
        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents
        and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.\n\nFor more information on

        Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters","description":"1.1. What
        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information

        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.

        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of

        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued

        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        NFIP Redacted Policies","description":"Congress passed the National Flood
        Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood
        Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood
        hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection.
        The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered
        the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its
        creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA''s Write
        Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures
        as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures
        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,
        and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of
        the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and
        processing insurance claims. \n\nThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments
        for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund
        (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42
        U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated
        fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. \n\nThis data
        set is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting
        platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.\n\nThe
        NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf)

        Assignments","description":"1.1 What is the data in the submission?\n\nMission
        Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order
        issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified
        task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. \n\nMission
        Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management
        under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow
        for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources
        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system

        Assistance (HMA) grant programs. FEMA administers three programs that provide
        funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses
        and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs
        are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance

        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents

        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information
        on HMGP please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation.\n\nMissing values

        Archived Alerts","description":"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System
        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.
        To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies
        with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.\nThe
        data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found
        in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf\nSee

        is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the
        IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450
        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of
        each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours

        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability
        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued
        through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards
        Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. \nNote that the original IPAWS
        CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON
        object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as
        a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original
        format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such
        as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message.

        Mitigation Plan Statuses","description":"The data found on this page comes
        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,

        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        for all new PA grants has reduced the role of its predecessor, the Emergency
        Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE). When all remaining EMMIE
        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system
        of record for obligation.\n\nA descriptive list of two of the code fields

        information on both Non-Disaster (ND) and Assistance to Firefighter Grants
        (AFG) data. ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants
        Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.\n\nThe only
        measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can
        be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.\n\nAFG
        awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically
        assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security
        Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important
        to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State
        actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through
        requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum
        amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.\n\nGrants guidance
        is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program
        has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives,
        and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents
        and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.\n\nFor more information on

        Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters","description":"1.1. What
        is the data in the submission?\n\nIndividual Assistance is provided by the
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who
        have sustained losses due to disasters.\n\nHomeowners, renters, and business
        owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles,
        personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared
        disaster may apply for disaster assistance.\n\nDisaster assistance may include
        grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured
        and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral
        expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related
        expenses.\n\nDisaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not
        affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs,
        welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps,
        Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nThis
        dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the
        Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass
        Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training
        Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services
        (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program
        (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance
        (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA''s IHP
        unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf\n\nIndividual
        data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within
        the dataset.\n\n1.2. How is it generated?\n\nThe data is derived from the
        National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been
        used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA''s Individual Assistance (IA)
        program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise
        Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.\n\n1.3. How can the data
        be used?\n\nThe data can be used to analyze FEMA''s IA program response attributes.
        This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental
        organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban
        Development''s (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for
        rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data
        was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for
        use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.\n\nOpenFEMA customers
        can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular
        communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents
        in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations
        in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where
        additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.\n\nCommunity groups
        in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive
        data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and
        fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households
        and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand
        and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective
        and equitable recovery.\n\nCitation: The Agency''s preferred citation for

        note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address
        and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation
        algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the
        way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials
        do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an
        address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location
        on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match
        they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries
        (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in
        the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics
        perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and
        still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.\n\nThis is raw,

        Mitigation Grant Program - Property Acquisitions","description":"This dataset
        lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard
        Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local
        governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major
        disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation
        Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell
        their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation
        for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to
        recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost
        some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford
        Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be
        restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity\n\nAcquisition
        or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the
        State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the
        property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate
        in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster
        struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market
        value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and
        prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information

        (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation''s alert and warning infrastructure
        that unifies the United States'' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency
        Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather
        Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services.
        IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated
        over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.\nOrganized
        and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state,
        local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the
        public using a range of national and local alerting systems.\nThis data set
        contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code
        (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement,
        Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe.
        It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The
        dataset is published with a twenty four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk
        of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed.
        The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty four (24) hours
        ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert
        at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd,
        these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd
        and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving
        active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system.

        Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of

        so if the site goes down, you will not be able to access the information.
        This happens only on rare occasions. \nEarlier messages may contain non-compliant
        geocoordinates which will not work if you try to use them. Recent versions
        of the software check these coordinates for compliance. \nThis dataset is
        not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered
        an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research
        purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after
        the official IPAWS message has been sent. To request access to alerts issued

        from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program''s  Mitigation Planning Portal
        (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation
        plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management
        Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions
        are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status
        of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking
        of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses
        to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.\nHazard mitigation
        planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters.
        It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying
        natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area.
        After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting
        people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking
        the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain
        types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation
        plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding
        hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation
        Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning)\nHazard
        mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments
        to:\n- \tIncrease education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and
        vulnerabilities\n- Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments,
        organizations, businesses, and the public\n- Identify long-term strategies
        that seek to reduce risk\n- Align risk reduction with other state, tribal,
        territorial or local objectives\n- Identify implementation actions to focus
        resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities\n- Connect priorities
        to potential funding sources\n- Increase investment in mitigation actions\nA
        FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of
        non-emergency disaster assistance.\n\nPlease note that jurisdictions may participate
        in multiple plans. This is raw, unedited data that is dependent on Regional

        NFIP Redacted Policies","description":"Congress passed the National Flood
        Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood
        Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood
        hazard identification, manage floodplain, and provide insurance protection.
        The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered
        the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its
        creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA''s Write
        Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures
        as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures
        to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP
        operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance
        companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA''s fiduciary
        and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications
        are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming,
        and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of
        the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and
        processing insurance claims. \n\nThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments
        for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund
        (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42
        U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated
        fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. \n\nThis data
        set is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting
        platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.\n\nThe
        NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf)

        Assignments","description":"1.1 What is the data in the submission?\n\nMission
        Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order
        issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified
        task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. \n\nMission
        Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management
        under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow
        for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources
        to support disaster needs.\n\n1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?\n\nFEMA
        issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential
        declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.\n\nWhen
        States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can
        fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission
        Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other
        Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement
        of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8
        (c).\n\n1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?\n\nMission Assignments are
        administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic
        forms within FEMA''s financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes
        essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support
        and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor,
        statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended
        to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance
        dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work,
        or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This
        process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes
        place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission
        assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing
        and reimbursement.\n\nThis data set contains information required as part
        of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The
        Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information
        for stakeholders:\n- State or Tribal Government\n- Disaster Number\n- Description
        of Disaster \n- Agency\n- Request for Assistance\n- Obligations/Estimate\n-
        Date Obligated\n- Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government
        is responsible (the cost share)\n\nFor more information on Mission Assignments,
        the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform
        Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov\n\n1.4 How is the data generated?\n\nThe
        data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System
        (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments
        for FEMA''s Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset
        was extracted using FEMA''s Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable,
        uniform data.\n\n1.5 How can the data be used?\n\nThe data provides information
        regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response
        to Stafford Act incidents.  \n\nNote: The disaster costs reflected are not
        actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available
        to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical
        needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial
        report and should not be considered an official federal report. \n\nCitation:

        Assistance (PA) Applicants - Delivery Model'' dataset includes data from the
        FEMA PA Grants Manager/Grants Portal system. In 2016, FEMA developed this
        two-part platform as a new information technology system to document PA projects
        in formulation with a seamless transition to grant obligation. This dataset
        includes all active subrecipients/applicants, and summarizes their projects
        by their status in the PA national delivery model process. The PA delivery
        model data differs from other dataset as it specifies in what phase current
        grants are in and this can be time sensitive to the public. It will also provide
        the phase for better context into the Grants Awards activity which is focused
        on only awarded Grants. \nShort description of the PA Phases: \nPhase I -
        Operational Planning\nIdentify applicants'' disaster impacts and recovery
        priorities.\nPhase II - Damage Intake and Eligibility Analysis\nCapture and
        document all of the incident-related damages\nPhase III - Scoping and Costing\nFurther

        functions are moved to the Grants Manager and Grants Portal in the near future,
        EMMIE will be sunsetted and the Grants Manager and Grants Portal will become
        the official system of record. Currently, EMMIE remains the official system
